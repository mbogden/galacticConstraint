# GalacticConstraints

This repository, **GalacticConstraints**, is part of an ongoing effort to reorganize and streamline the development of a scientific software project aimed at exploring and analyzing galactic constraints. The reorganization focuses on improving code structure, enhancing readability, and facilitating easier collaboration and maintenance.   The old repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mbogden/galaxyJSPAM.git).

## Current Status

As of now, this repository is in the early stages of setup and development. The codebase is being restructured to adopt better software development practices, including modular design, comprehensive documentation, and robust testing frameworks.

## Objectives

- **Modularize** the architecture to improve code reusability and maintainability.
- **Document** all components to ensure clarity of purpose and usage.
- **Test** extensively to ensure reliability and accuracy of results.
- **Optimize** performance to handle large datasets and complex computations.

## Coming Soon

Stay tuned for updates as we progress in migrating and reorganizing the project's components. Future updates will include detailed documentation, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
